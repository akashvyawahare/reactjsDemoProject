/**
 *todo) React lifecycle of this component -->
 * 
 *? [MOUNTING PHASE]
 * 
 * constructor() method will be called first.
 * 
 * then, the render() method will be called.
 * 
 * in render(), it will check if userDetails is null or not. If yes it will return <Skeleton/> and execution of render() will be completed.(It will be definitely empty for the component's first render).
 * 
 *? [UPDATING PHASE]
 * 
 * then, componentDidMount will be called.
 * 
 * In, componentDidMount(), we are fetching the api and updating the state variable 'userDetails' by storing APIs response data in it. 
 * 
 * so, as the state variable updates, the component renders again, and the render() method called again with the updated data.
 * 
 * now, as our component rendered again, the componentDidUpdate() method will be called. this method runs after every update(re-render) of our component.
